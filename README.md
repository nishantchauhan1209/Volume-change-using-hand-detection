# Volume-change-using-hand-detection
You can change your system's volume just by using your hand.
Is'nt it intreseting, just think from now onwards you don't have to search for the volume buttons on your keyboards, and most of the keyboards actually dont have the volume key.
I have made this project, this project will access your camera and detect your palm and fingers and adjust the volume by detection the distance between your two fingers (thumb and first finger).
Strech your thumb and first finger to increase the volume and for decreasing the volume just lower the distanjce between your fingers(thumb and first finger).
